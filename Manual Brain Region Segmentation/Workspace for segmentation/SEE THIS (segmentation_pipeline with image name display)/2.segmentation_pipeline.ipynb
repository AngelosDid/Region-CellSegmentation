    "### zoom_and_pick_bregma ():\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. The alternation between different brema points is done by changing the bregma_index\n",
    "##### 2. Information about the bregma displayed on screen is on the cv2.putText in this function\n",
    "##### 3. The width and height changes according to the scale_percent change and are used to create the resized_image. The resized_image is only useful for display. The cropping in UseROIStoSegment.ipynb is done on the original image with corrected dimensions of the polygon (see scaled_roi_points variable in user_drawing().\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "### draw_polygon ():\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. To completely understand the arguments of this function, the documentation of cv2.SetMouseCallback must be studied.\n",
    "##### 2. The drawing variable dictates if the user is in the phase of drawing, that is, still be pressing the left mouse click. As long as the user is pressing the left click, coordinates x and y are constantly collected (these are all coordinates of the polygon)\n",
    "##### 3. The 'region' variable is delibarately not a list but a cycle from itertools in order to allow infinite alternation through elements. Therefore, the user will never reach to a final index.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### decide_on_drawing():\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "##### 1. It is important to note here that although this function is primarily created to make a decision about the drawing (save or retry) , it is running independently of whether a drawing has been created or not (Note that the exit option, the polylines and imshow are outside the 'if polygon is not None'.). This function calls cv2.SetMouseCallback when click events are detected, which by its turn calls draw_polygon. Practically, it provides the frame for the display of images and action on them. In sum, the function works like this : (a) check whether there is a polygon created (b) if so, save the ROI coordinates after you rescale them to the proportionate original size of image (c) while you are checking for (a), if there is not a polygon created and escape is pressed, exit the program.\n",
    "##### 2. Every time the while loop breaks, there is the chance that the decide_on_drawing() will start again before the main loop of the main code jumps to the new image (for img_name in images_allnames :) . Whether the function will be called again inside this iteration of the main loop is depended on the retry variable. If the retry variable equals True, it means that the user has selected to re-draw the ROI. So the function is called again.\n",
    "##### 3. The segmentation is done on a clone image because the function might be called several times if the user wants to re-draw. This way, the previous contours, bregma labels and region labels are also refreshed. \n",
    "##### 4. Note that if a polygon is created, it will not be None anymore but a Polygon instead. Which means that if the user decided to re-draw, that wouldn't be possible based on the first if condition under the while True loop (if polygon is not None). However, polygon is reset to None when the user wants to re-draw.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### define_bregmata() & define_regions():\n",
    "##### These function will only be called if a 'Bregmata_and_regions.pkl' file does not exist on the workspace. By workspace we define the directory in which this file you read is. The functions prompt the user to submit the regions of interest and bregma points of interest that wants to use.\n",
