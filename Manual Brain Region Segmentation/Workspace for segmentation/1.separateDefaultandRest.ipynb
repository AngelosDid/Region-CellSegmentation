The rest channels are channels that the user will not see during segmentation. The rest channels file will be a list containing images in numpy array. Both the default and the rest channels that are created here are in pickle format. When the pickle is loaded, the default (np.array) or restchannels (list with np arrays) can be accessed. <br>\n",

A random image (randomly_picked_img) is selected outside of this function. If the number of channels of this image (which is indicated in the last element of the SOMEIMAGEHERE.shape) is larger than the users input, then an error will occur. Of note, the order of channels might have been reordered, thereby leading to a selection of a wrong channel for display by the user. Hence, it is recommended that the user tests what number corresponds to what channel by selecting a directory with only one image. Then, (s)he can open the segmentation_pipeline.ipynb and test if the inserted number corresponds to the right number. \n",
